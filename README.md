# Generate Partitions Communities
This code is part of my doctoral research. The aim is build the graphs and apply communities detection methods to get the hybrid partitions.


## Scripts
This source code consists of an R project for R Studio and the following R scripts:

1. libraries.R
2. utils.R
3. functions.R
4. communities.R
5. run.R
6. gpc.R
7. config-files.R


## Preparing your experiment

### STEP 1
A file called _datasets-original.csv_ must be in the *root project directory*. This file is used to read information about the datasets and they are used in the code. We have 90 multilabel datasets in this _.csv_ file. If you want to use another dataset, please, add the following information about the dataset in the file:


| Parameter    | Status    | Description                                           |

1 - Because it is the first column the number is always 1.

2 - [Click here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-41111-8) to get explanation about each property.


### STEP 2
To run this experiment you need the _X-Fold Cross-Validation_ files and they must be compacted in **tar.gz** format. You can download these files, with 10-folds, ready for multilabel dataset by clicking [here](). For a new dataset, in addition to including it in the **datasets-original.csv** file, you must also run this code [here](). In the repository in question you will find all the instructions needed to generate the files in the format required for this experiment. The **tar.gz** file can be placed on any directory on your computer or server. The absolute path of the file should be passed as a parameter in the configuration file that will be read by **gpc.R** script. The dataset folds will be loaded from there.


### STEP 3
You need to have installed all the Java, Python and R packages required to execute this code on your machine or server. This code does not provide any type of automatic package installation!

You can use the [Conda Environment]() that I created to perform this experiment. Below are the links to download the files. Try to use the command below to extract the environment to your computer:

```
conda env create -file AmbienteTeste.yaml
```

See more information about Conda environments [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) 

You can also run this code using the AppTainer [container]() that I'm using to run this code in a SLURM cluster. Please, check this [tutorial]() (in portuguese) to see how to do that. 


### STEP 4
To run this code you will need a configuration file saved in *csv* format and with the following information:

| Config          | Value                                                                            | 
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Dataset_Path    | Absolute path to the directory where the dataset's tar.gz is stored              |
| Temporary_Path  | Absolute path to the directory where temporary processing will be performed * 1  |
| Graph_Path      | Absolute path to the directory where the graphs are                              |
| Similarity      | Must be "jaccard", "rogers" or another similarity measure                        |
| Dataset_Name    | Dataset name according to *dataset-original.csv* file                            |
| Number_Dataset  | Dataset number according to *dataset-original.csv* file                          |
| Number_Folds    | Number of folds used in cross validation                                         |
| Number_Cores    | Number of cores for parallel processing                                          |


1 - Use directorys like */dev/shm*, *tmp* or *scratch* here.


You can save configuration files wherever you want. The absolute path will be passed as a command line argument.



## Software Requirements
This code was develop in RStudio Version 1.4.1106 © 2009-2021 RStudio, PBC "Tiger Daylily" (2389bc24, 2021-02-11) for Ubuntu Bionic Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) QtWebEngine/5.12.8 Chrome/69.0.3497.128 Safari/537.36. The R Language version was: R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) -- "Camp Pontanezen" Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit).

## Hardware Requirements
This code may or may not be executed in parallel, however, it is highly recommended that you run it in parallel. The number of cores can be configured via the command line (number_cores). If number_cores = 1 the code will run sequentially. In our experiments, we used 10 cores. For reproducibility, we recommend that you also use ten cores. This code was tested with the birds dataset in the following machine:

*System:*

Host: bionote | Kernel: 5.8.0-53-generic | x86_64 bits: 64 | Desktop: Gnome 3.36.7 | Distro: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (Focal Fossa)

*CPU:*

Topology: 6-Core | model: Intel Core i7-10750H | bits: 64 | type: MT MCP | L2 cache: 12.0 MiB | Speed: 800 MHz | min/max: 800/5000 MHz Core speeds (MHz): | 1: 800 | 2: 800 | 3: 800 | 4: 800 | 5: 800 | 6: 800 | 7: 800 | 8: 800 | 9: 800 | 10: 800 | 11: 800 | 12: 800 |

Then the experiment was executed in a cluster at UFSCar.


## RUN
To run the code, open the terminal, enter the *~/Generate-Partitions-Communities/R* folder, and type

```
Rscript gpc.R [absolute_path_to_config_file]
```

Example:

```
Rscript gpc.R "~/Generate-Partitions-Communities/config-files/jaccard/mj-GpositiveGO.csv"
```
